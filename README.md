<h2>Project Drescription:</h2>
<p>"Hue Are You?" is a quick and simple personality test to help a user find a color that matches their personality. Also, it will produce both a HEX code and an RGB code so that the user may use it to style their application.</p>
<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>To help an individual who has trouble choosing a color. The test will help find a color based off their answers in the personality test.</p>  
<h2>User Story:</h2>
<p>As a user, I need help picking a color. So, I would like a quiz made that gives me a color based on my answers. When I receive my color, I would like the HEX and RGB code to show so that I may use it for my own application.</p>
